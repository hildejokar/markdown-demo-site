# Female Stoics

Thinking of the great ancient Stoic philosophers, names like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus, Cato, Zeno, Cleanthes, Hecato, or Musonius Rufus tend to be at the top of our minds. However, `these are only the Stoics whose names survive to us` ,through ancient writings which miraculously survived thousands of years.

But how about female Stoics? Were there any of them back in the days?  For sure! Stoicism is a philosophy of action, so while what has been kept is mostly men's writings, women too have lived lives according to Stoic principles. 

In fact, Musonius Rufus - a teacher of many men in Stoicism - stated that:

> It is not men alone who possess eagerness and a natural inclination towards virtue, but women also. Women are pleased no less than men by noble and just deeds, and reject the opposite of such actions. Since that is so, why is it appropriate for men to seek out and examine how they might live well, that is, to practise philosophy, but not women?

Three ancient Stoic women are Porcia Catonis, Annia Cornificia Faustina Minor, and Fannia.

## Plutarch's writings 

## Life of Brutus

Plutarch’s _Life Of Cato_ concludes with: 

> And still more true is it that the daughter of Cato was deficient neither in prudence nor courage. She was the wife of the Brutus who slew Caesar, was privy to the conspiracy itself, and gave up her life in a manner worthy of her noble birth and her lofty character, as is told in the Life of Brutus.
 
### Courageus

Plutarch further writes that: 

> This Porcia, being addicted to philosophy, a great lover of her husband, and full of an understanding courage, resolved not to inquire into Brutus’s secrets before she had made this trial of herself. She turned all her attendants out of her chamber, and taking a little knife, such as they use to cut nails with, she gave herself a deep gash in the thigh; upon which followed a great flow of blood, and soon after, violent pains and a shivering fever, occasioned by the wound.

### Defying pain

According to Plutarch, Porcia said to Brutus: 

> I know very well that women seem to be of too weak a nature to be trusted with secrets; but certainly, Brutus, a virtuous birth and education, and the company of the good and honorable, are of some force to the forming our manners; and I can boast that I am the daughter of Cato, and the wife of Brutus, in which two titles though before I put less confidence, yet now I have tried myself, and find that I can bid defiance to pain.
